#SpeakEz

##Inspiration
Public speaking is one of those anxieties that everyone has. It is difficult to overcome, mainly because people lack the opportunity to get in front of a group of people to practice speaking. This lack of practice exacerbates the fear, creating a positive feedback loop, making public speaking the worst phobia in North America. We built SpeakEz with the hopes of helping people make public speaking a normal thing.

##What it does
SpeakEz presents the user with the proper environment to practice public speaking. By utilizing a virtual reciprocating crowd, the user can prepare for any public speaking scenario. Users have the option of listening to their own voices (something many dread), as well as seeing their own hand movements. This allows the user to become comfortable with public speaking in private until he or she becomes a public-speaking pro!
